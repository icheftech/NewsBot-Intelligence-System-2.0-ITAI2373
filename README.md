📌 Project Overview

The NewsBot Intelligence System 2.0 is a scalable, production-oriented NLP platform designed to analyze, interpret, and explore global news content. This project expands upon the original NewsBot midterm by integrating advanced natural language processing techniques, modular system design, and multilingual intelligence.

The system demonstrates end-to-end AI development, from data ingestion and preprocessing to advanced analysis, summarization, and interactive exploration. It is designed as a portfolio-quality project suitable for academic evaluation and real-world AI applications.
